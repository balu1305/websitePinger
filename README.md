In todayâ€™s interconnected world, ensuring the availability and reliability of critical servers and services is essential for businesses. However, manually monitoring the health of multiple servers is time-consuming and prone to human error. There is a need for an automated system that can:

Continuously monitor the availability of servers.
Detect and report downtime or network issues.
Provide real-time alerts to system administrators.
Log historical data for analysis and troubleshooting.
This project aims to build a Network Health Monitor and Alert System that automates server monitoring, provides actionable insights, and ensures timely responses to network issues.

Key Features
Server Monitoring:

Ping multiple servers (e.g., google.com, github.com, yourcompany.com) to check their availability.
Handle platform-specific differences (Windows, Linux, Mac).
Real-Time Alerts:

Send email or SMS notifications when a server goes down.
Use APIs like Twilio (for SMS) or SMTP (for email) for notifications.
Historical Logging:

Log server status (up/down) and response times to a file or database.
Generate reports for analysis (e.g., uptime percentage, downtime trends).
User Interface:

Build a simple command-line interface (CLI) or web-based dashboard to view server statuses.
Use libraries like Flask or Streamlit for a web interface.
Scalability:

Allow users to add/remove servers dynamically.
Support monitoring of hundreds of servers efficiently.
Error Handling:

Handle edge cases like invalid hostnames, network timeouts, or firewall restrictions.
